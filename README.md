**Postal** is a complete, self-hosted mail server — the open-source alternative to Sendgrid, Mailgun or Postmark, ready to run on your own infrastructure.

This is a fork maintained by [Startup Pack](https://startuppack.eu) that extends Postal with a full **provisioning API**, multi-tenant SCIM, and enterprise SSO features not available in the upstream project.

> ⚠️ **Still running in dev mode.** The Startup Pack deployment currently runs in **development** mode (Rails `development` — `RAILS_ENV` is not set, hence the "dev" badge in the UI footer). Before real production use, switch it to **production**: set `RAILS_ENV=production` (and `NODE_ENV=production`) on the web/smtp/worker processes, confirm `secret_key_base` and precompiled assets. Until then expect verbose logs, no asset caching and dev-mode behaviour.
